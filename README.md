I'm an aeronautical engineer with passion for UAVs, their building and programming. I use ROS and Computer Vision techniques to improve autonomous features of my drones. I would like to find a company for cooperation in the fields of UAV, robotics and computer vision.

I would like to do more complex projects and I'm interested what would hiring managers appreciate. Maybe You can suggest me some projects or give me links to interesting projects that are already on github.
