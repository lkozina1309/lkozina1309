Hi, I’m @lkozina1309 (Luka Kozina), Aerospace Engineer from Nasice, Croatia.

I’m interested in drones, aviation, robotics and technology.

I’m currently learning Ardupilot, OpenCV, ROS, Tensorflow and Pytorch.

I’m looking to collaborate on autonomous drones, robotics and computer vision projects.
